A bit farther from the action but great if you want to relax and walk to restaurants, bars, and activities. Be sure to check out the Winter Park Boat Tour! </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p>We also encourage you to check out AirBnBs which are very affordable in our area. Search for Oviedo, Lake Mary, Altamonte Springs, Winter Park, or downtown Orlando. If you want to stay near the parks search for Kissimmee. All of these locations are within a 30 minute drive from the festivities. Downtown Orlando in particular has become a foodie destination with a cool mid-century feel!
        <br></br>
            Central Florida is unfortunately lacking in good public transportation. We highly suggest renting a car from the airport if you will be flying in. If you would like to find a carpool buddy please let us know; we are happy to help. </p>

                <h2>Things to Do</h2>
                <p> Mid-January is an excellent time to visit the theme parks with good weather and smaller crowds! But if you are not into Mickey Mouse, here are some authentic Florida wonders:
            </header>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Beaches:</b> New Smyrna Beach (Noelle's favorite), Daytona Beach, and Cape Canaveral National Seashore (A.J.'s favorite)
                <li><b>Gators: </b>Black Hammock Restaurant, Airboat rides (drive down state route 50 towards the beach - we like Captain John. It helps if you call ahead), Gatorland Park
            	<li><b>Aquatic Mammals:</b> Blue Springs State Park (Manatees, especially if it is cold out), Manatee Park in New Smyrna (better for dolphins this time of year)
                <li><b>Freshwater Springs:</b> Swimmable year-round! Better yet, rent a kayak! Wekiva Springs, DeLeon Springs (save room for pancakes at the old mill), Rock Springs State Park
                <li><b>Oranges: </b>In season in January! Visit Hollieanna storefront in Orlando, or drive out to Christmas, FL to see the groves
                <li><b>Shopping:</b> Visit Park Ave in Winter Park, FL for browsing (be sure to try the chocolate popcorn at Killwin's candy store) Downtown DeLand, the Premium Outlets
                <li><b>Culture: </b>The Enzian Movie Theater, the Maitland Art Center, the Polasek Museum, the Audobon Society, Leu Gardens, Kennedy Space Ceter
                <li><b> Further Away:</b> St. Augustine, the oldest town in the US, via Mount Dora makes for a great road trip!
            </ul>
