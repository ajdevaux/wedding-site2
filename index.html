            <h2>Noelle and A.J.</h2>
            <p>met in the most romantic of all possible circumstances: a science conference.
                Undeterred by his nerdy attempts at "flirtation", she agreed to give him a chance
                and go in a date with him. He proceeded to do his very best to show her all the best
                places in the city of Boston.
            </p>
            <p>They could talk for hours while at dinner or on road trips across New England. They
               couldn't help admiring they way each other thought, and appreciating new perspectives
               and ideas about all facets life.

            <p>Their love of adventure would frequently separate them, as he left to hike the Appalachian Trail,
                and she would spend months at sea in the name of science. They always found each other again,
                sometimes on remote Pacific islands, or among the glaciers of the Alps.
            </p>
            <p>On August 21, 2017 a solar eclipse crossed North America, and they travelled to Grand Teton National Park
                to view the event. There, atop Table Mountain, under the crescent sun, A.J. dropped to his knees and asked
                Noelle if she would spend the rest of her life with him.

                   Orlando is where Noelle calls home, and her childhood reverend Father George has been kind enough to officiate the ceremony.
                   When you leave the theme parks and resorts, Central Florida has beautiful natural attractions and old southern charm that is highly underrated.</p>
                <p>Plus, the weather in January is usually fantastic.</p>

			<header><h2>The Proposal &mdash;<br> Her Story</h2></header>
			<p style="font-size:85%"> I knew something was up when we were getting ready to go out to dinner the
			night of our 4 year anniversary and suddenly Jason declared that he had no
			black socks, and so he must immediately run to Target, and then bolted out
			the door. It was quite un-Jason-like, so I was pretty suspicious, but also really hungry for dinner.
			Dinner, as it turned out, was at this lovely restaurant called Forepaugh's in St Paul,
			and we got through the meal without any surprises, so I started to think that
			all of my suspicions were for naught. But then the dessert menu came, and
			Jason told me not to order because he had other plans for desssert.
			But, before dessert, he asked if I would like to go explore the upstairs of the restaurant
			(which is apparently a haunted house). I'm a sucker for 19th century
			architecture, so we went upstairs to explore. I was investigating the upper
			landing when Jason informed me that he had an important question that he had
			been meaning to ask, and my heart jumped, of course. But then
		       	he told me that he'd been
			designing a website and he wanted to ask what I thought. I had thought
			he was teasing, so I punched him. However, he actually did have a website
			on his phone that he wanted me to see, and on the bottom was a sweet
			little message and the words "Will you marry me?" and I burst into tears
			as soon as I saw him get down on one knee. After we calmed down, we called
			our parents, cried more, and then we went to dessert, which turned out to
			be Perkins and our friends were there! We celebrated with tears, hugs, and pie.
			Also, it turned out the website he showed me on his phone was this one:
			jasonandali.aretotallygettingmarried.com! So we've re-vamped it to be
			our wedding website!</p>

			<header><h2>His Story</h2></header>
			<p style="font-size:85%">Okay, so here's the thing about the socks. There was a mix-up with the
			jewelry store, so they didn't have the ring ready when I went to get it that
			morning. They said they'd try to get it sorted out as soon as possible,
			but I had to get home and get ready for dinner. Then, just before I got
			home, they called and said that it was ready sooner than expected! So I had
			to come up with a way to go pick it up without Ali noticing. I ran through
			a bunch of plans in my head&hellip; I could just propose as we headed out the door,
			and say that we needed to go get the ring, I could blindfold her and say
			that the restaurant was a surprise, and then make a "pit stop"&hellip; Ultimately,
			I settled on the socks. In fairness, I legitimately only had one black sock
			in my drawer, so it wasn't a total lie.</p>

			<p style="font-size:85%">At that point, I hadn't quite started the ball rolling, so I had a decision
			to make &mdash; propose tonight, or delay it? With the ring ending up getting
			finished early, I decided that all signs pointed to yes. I had already asked
			her parents' permission, so I called my parents to let them know and sent a
			text to our friends to tell them and ask them out to Perkins for dessert.
			The whole thing was fairly improvised. I had put together the website and my
			note, but other than that, I didn't have a firm plan. I thought about asking
			early on in the dinner, so that she could be excited about it, but it just
			never ended up feeling right. When we overheard the table next to us talking
			to their server about exploring the house/restaurant, it all clicked into place.
			It's a good thing I waited, because I don't know if we could have made it
			through dinner otherwise. We dashed off to Perkins, calling our parents
			along the way, and we were treated to some complimentary pies &mdash; a
			perfect end to the night.</p>
